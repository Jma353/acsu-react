## Requirements
* `Node.js` found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* `NPM 4.*.*` (because I'm old-school like that), which can be grabbed by running `npm install -g npm@4`

## Running
To run the app, execute the following:

```bash
npm start
```

## Developing
For the most pleasant developing experience, I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/)
with [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) installed.
